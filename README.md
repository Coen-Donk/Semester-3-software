Learning outcomes and what I've done for them, up until now. For a more detailed explanation of my progress please see: https://github.com/Coen-Donk/Semester-3-software/wiki/Portfolio-individual-project

### 1. You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.

https://vue-space-lb8g42a1u-coendonk.vercel.app/

For now I've designed a very basic full stack web application. The web socket is yet to be connected online, but it does work offline and the code is visible here on github. 

(I am considering of keeping it like this for now as the online Web App will still function if you host the Web Socket locally)

ORM Has been shown in a prototype project here: [https://github.com/Coen-Donk/Semester-3-software/tree/Development/Practice%20Projects/ORM/ORM%20Console]

My explanation as for why can be seen here: [https://github.com/Coen-Donk/Semester-3-software/wiki/Portfolio-individual-project#orm]

### 2. You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.

For this learning outcome I've designed Unit testing inside my Web Socket application to ensure that the methods are all working correctly, as well as the connections. To ensure I've tested everything I gave myself the requirement to have a minimum of 90% Test coverage. 

Further more I've also implemented Code Analysis whenever I attempt to push to my git.

Full detail can be viewed here: https://github.com/Coen-Donk/Semester-3-software/wiki/Portfolio-individual-project#testing

### 3. You choose and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project.

A report over my knowledges of agile working can be seen here:

I have already made a report on my research findings about Agile methodology frameworks, and I have designed user stories which you can see in my projects tab (These are not perfectly up-to-date as I'm prioritizing different aspects of what I want to learn instead of completing the project). 

You can find my findings here: https://github.com/Coen-Donk/Semester-3-software/wiki/Agile-Report
Explanation and argumentation about which methodology we've chosen in the group project and which one I chose in my IP can be seen here: https://github.com/Coen-Donk/Semester-3-software/wiki/Agile-Report#agile-framework-choice

### 4. You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.

CI has been created for the website which you can view here: https://github.com/Coen-Donk/Vue-Space-App/settings/code_review_limits

CD has been implemented as well, as any push to the github immediately pushes my code to vercel.app, and on sunday all code is automatically pushed to the vercel app as well.

### 5. You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.

For this learning outcome I covered what kind of differences I encountered in my semester 4 Creative Technology Team
You can find the report on this in here: https://github.com/Coen-Donk/Semester-3-software/wiki/Cultural-differences-during-semester-4

### 6. You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques.

I have designed an architectural design (the C4-model level 1 and 2) for my application. I have stuck with Level 1 and 2 for now as they best display the overall structure of the app and level 3 might still change frequently as my knowledge of Vue.js and the Java Web-socket changes. 
The documentation can be seen here: [https://github.com/Coen-Donk/Semester-3-software/tree/Development/Documentation}

### 7. You analyze and describe simple business processes that are related to your project.

A busness process report can be viewed here: https://github.com/Coen-Donk/Semester-3-software/wiki/Business-Process-Ping-pong

### 8.  You act in a professional manner during software development and learning.

I feel that up until now I have always stuck with a professional manner in both the GP and IP. With the GP I take into the account the feedback of the stakeholders together with my group mates and we keep the priority of the
client, instead of making our op priority. 

With the IP I frequently ask feedback on different aspects of my project and incorperate my feedback, or explain why I've gone a different route. The feedback I've received can be seen on feedpulse

This semester I also have to write Research reports (In specific two, one about security and one free of choice). A list of my Research reports will be written here
