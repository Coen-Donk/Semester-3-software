## Naming conventions document

This document contains naming conventions used in Java, VueJS, Javascript and C#. A set of global conventions and practices can be found under the section "Common conventions & practices". Each code language has its own set of specific conventions where applicable, and they can be found under their respective headers. 

### Common Conventions & Practices
This section outlines naming conventions that are common across all languages.

#### Naming conventions

- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Use camelCase for variable and function names, except when naming a class or constructor.
- Use PascalCase for naming classes and constructors.
- Use all capital letters (uppercase) for naming constants.

### Language-specific conventions & practices
This section outlines specific naming conventions for each programming language.

#### VueJS

- For components, filenames have to be written in PascalCase. 
- Function and variable names are written in camelCase.
- For CSS styles, use kebab-case.

#### Javascript

- Filenames must be written in camelCase.
- Function and variable names should be written in camelCase.
- For constants, use all capital letters (uppercase).

#### Java

- Class files should be written in PascalCase.
- Classnames have to match filenames.
- Use camelCase for naming methods and variables, except when naming a class or constructor.
- Use PascalCase for naming classes and constructors.
- Use all capital letters (uppercase) for naming constants.
- Use snake_case for naming package names.

### Definitions
Here are some definitions of the writing methods mentioned in the document:

- camelCase: a writing method wherein internal words are capitalized, excluding the first. e.g. `helloNewWorld`
- PascalCase: a writing method wherein all words are capitalized, including the first. e.g. `HelloNewWorld`
- snake_case: a writing method wherein all internal words are separated using an underscore. e.g. `hello_new_world`
- kebab-case: a writing method wherein all internal words are separated using a dash. e.g. `hello-new-world`
