# Code Practices Document

## Introduction:
This document provides guidelines for writing high-quality code and following good development practices.

### Code Quality:
1. Use meaningful variable names.
2. Limit line length to 80 characters.
3. Use comments to explain complex code.
4. Use consistent indentation.
5. Remove unused code.

### Development Processes:
1. Use version control for all code.
2. Use a feature branch workflow.
3. Write automated tests for all code.
4. Use continuous integration for automated testing.

### Best Practices:
1. Use object-oriented programming principles in Java.
2. Use object-oriented programming principles in JavaScript.
3. Use object-oriented programming principles in C#.

### Definitions:
1. Version control: a system for managing changes to code over time.
2. Feature branch workflow: a development process where each feature is developed on a separate branch before being merged into the main codebase.
3. Automated testing: the practice of writing code that automatically tests other code to ensure that it behaves as expected.
