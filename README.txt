Learning outcomes and what I've done for them, up until now. For a more detailed explanation of my progress please see: https://github.com/Coen-Donk/Semester-3-software/wiki/Portfolio-individual-project

1. You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.

For now I've designed a very basic full stack web application. The web socket is yet to be connected online, but it does work offline and the code is visible here on github.

2. You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.

3. You choose and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project.

4. You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.
CI has been created for the website which you can view here: https://github.com/Coen-Donk/Vue-Space-App/settings/code_review_limits
CD has been implemented as well, as any push to the github immediately pushes my code to vercel.app.

5. You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.

6. You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques.

7. You analyze and describe simple business processes that are related to your project.

8.  You act in a professional manner during software development and learning.
